# TronRoyale

## Overview
TronRoyale is a browser-based game inspired by classic Tron light cycle battles. Players navigate a continuously growing tail and must avoid collisions with their own trail to survive.

## Features
- Real-time gameplay using HTML5 Canvas
- Turn-based movement recorded as vertices
- Collision detection for both tail and boundaries
- Responsive design that adjusts to window resizing

## How to Play
Use the arrow keys to control your cycle:
- **Up Arrow:** Move up
- **Down Arrow:** Move down
- **Left Arrow:** Move left
- **Right Arrow:** Move right

Avoid colliding with your own tail or the canvas boundaries. A collision will reset the game.

## File Structure
- `/frontend/index.html` – Main HTML file hosting the game.
- `/frontend/scripts/main.js` – Game logic including movement and collision detection.
- `/frontend/styles/main.css` – Styling for the game and page layout.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `/frontend/index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Enjoy the game!
